the joining gene segment of IGH rearrangements in genomic DNA producing 200–250 bp amplicons.
Note, that clonotypes in this preset are assembled by `{CDR2Begin:CDR3End}` feature, because primers are located in FR2 and FR4.

The Oncomine IGH FR1-J Assay is a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay for detection of somatic hypermutation (SHM) in the variable region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain of B-cell receptors. SHM increases the affinity of the B-cell receptor for antigen, post-VDJ recombination, and is frequently a region of interest in CLL research. Primers have been specifically designed to target framework 1 and joining gene regions of the immunoglobulin heavy chain, resulting in an amplicon ∼300 bp in length.
Note, that clonotypes in this preset are assembled by `{CDR1Begin:CDR3End}` feature, because primers are located in FR1 and FR4.

The Oncomine BCR IGHV Leader-J Assay is a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay for detection of somatic hypermutation (SHM) in the variable region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain of B-cell receptors. SHM increases the affinity of the B-cell receptor for antigen, post-VDJ recombination, and is used as a biomarker in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Primers have been specifically designed to target the leader and joining regions of the immunoglobulin heavy chain, resulting in an amplicon ∼480 bp in length.
Note, that clonotypes in this preset are assembled by `{FR1Begin:CDR3End}` feature, because primers are located in the leader sequence and FR4.
