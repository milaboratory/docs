The BD Rhapsody™ VDJ CDR3 Protocol utilizes the existing BD Rhapsody™ Targeted Kits and the human/mouse immune response primer panel and is designed to work alongside the BD® AbSeq Assay and BD® Single-Cell Multiplexing Kit (SMK). Details about the individual reagents needed to run the assay are included in the respective protocols. A dedicated bioinformatics pipeline is also available for you to analyze sequencing data generated using the CDR3 protocol.
