SMART-Seq Human BCR Kit (with UMIs) provides a sensitive and reproducible solution for generating high-quality NGS libraries for profiling the human BCR repertoire. The kit leverages SMART (Switching Mechanism at 5' end of RNA Template) full-length cDNA synthesis technology and pairs NGS with a 5’-RACE approach to capture the complete V(D)J variable regions of all human B-cell receptor (BCR) heavy (IgG/M/D/A/E) and light (IgK/L) chains. The By default the clones are assembled by `VDJRegion`, if needed (e.g. if the library has been sequenced with shorter read length) one can assemble clones by `CDR3` by adding `--assemble-clonotypes-by CDR3`.
 Mix-in option `--dont-split-clones-by C` may be used to not separate clones by isotypes.

SMARTer Human BCR IgG IgM H/K/L Profiling Kit pairs 5' RACE with NGS technology to provide a sensitive, accurate, and optimized approach to BCR profiling from RNA input samples. The 5' RACE method reduces variability and allows for priming from the constant region of BCR heavy or light chains. This kit combines these benefits with gene-specific amplification to capture complete V(D)J variable regions of BCR transcripts and provide a highly sensitive and reproducible method for profiling B-cell repertoires.
 By default the clones are assembled by `VDJRegion`, if needed (e.g. if the library has been sequenced with shorter read length) one can assemble clones by `CDR3` by adding `--assemble-clonotypes-by CDR3`.
 Mix-in option`--dont-split-clones-by C` mix-in may be used to not separate clones by isotypes.

The SMARTer Mouse TCR a/b Profiling Kit provides a powerful new solution for those seeking to perform T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire analysis using NGS. The kit employs a 5'-RACE-based approach to capture complete V(D)J variable regions of TCR transcripts, starting from as little as 10 ng to 500 ng of total RNA obtained from mouse spleen, thymus, or PBMCs, or from 1,000 to 10,000 purified T cells. As the name suggests, the kit can be used to generate data for both TCR-alpha and TCR-beta chain diversity, either in the same experiment or separately.
By default the clones are assembled by `VDJRegion`, if needed (e.g. if the library has been sequenced with shorter read length) one can assemble clones by `CDR3` by adding `--assemble-clonotypes-by CDR3`.
