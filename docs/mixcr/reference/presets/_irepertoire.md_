### iRepertoire

iRepertoire has multiple different primer systems that vary by the regions targeted, the desired read length, and the species.

Repertoire’s RepSeq service (formerly AMP2Seq) utilizes arm-PCR technology, which uses hundreds of VDJ-specific primers in one reaction to semi-quantitatively and inclusively amplify all the expressed V(D)Js in B or T cells from a single sample.

Short-read (SR) RNA-compatible human primers (presets that end with `sr`) cover from within Framework-3 (FR3) into the Constant Region (C). These SR primers are compatible with 100/150 paired end read (PER) sequencing. Long-read (LR) primer systems (presets that end with `ls`) cover from within FR1 and continue through to the C region. iRepertoire’s LR primers are compatible with 250 PER sequencing. Note that by default the clones are assembled by the regions not covered by the primers (`CDR3` for `sr` and `{CDR1Begin:FR4End}` for `lr`).

iRepertoire’s RepSeq+ service utilizes dam-PCR technology, which allows for any combination of TCR and BCR chains (TCR-alpha, TCR-beta, TCR-delta, TCR-gamma, BCR-IgHeavy, and BCR-kappa/lambda) to be amplified within a single reaction.

SR gDNA compatible primers (SR-VJ) cover from within FR3 to the end of the J-gene. These have been LR gDNA compatible primers cover from within FR1 to the end of the J-gene. LR versions are available for both human TCR beta and human IgH. These can be sequenced as single end read on 300-cycle kits or for full amplicon coverage as 250 PER sequencing.
