# `mixcr exportReports`

Export all reports from any MiXCR binary file (`.vdjca`, `.clns`, `.clna` and `.shmt`).

```
mixcr exportReports 
    [--step <step>] 
    [--yaml | --json] 
    [--force-overwrite] 
    [--no-warnings] 
    [--verbose] 
    [--help] 
    data.(vdjca|clns|clna|shmt) [report.(txt|json|yaml)]
```

Command line options:

`data.(vdjca|clns|clna|shmt)`
: Path to input file.

`[report.(txt|json|yaml)]`
: Path where to write reports. Print in stdout if omitted.

`--yaml`
: Export as yaml

`--json`
: Export as json

`--step <step>`
: Export report only for a specific step

`-f, --force-overwrite`
: Force overwrite of output file(s).

`-nw, --no-warnings`
: Suppress all warning messages.

`--verbose`
: Verbose messages.

`-h, --help`
: Show this help message and exit.

If the output file is not specified then MiXCR will print to a standard output. 

Example:
```shell
> mixcr exportReports SRR18293077.clns
```
