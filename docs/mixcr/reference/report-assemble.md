# `assemble` report

MiXCR generates a comprehensive summary of assembly performance. Assemble reports may be generated right along with [`assemble`](./mixcr-assemble.md) command using `-r`/`--report` for `txt` report and `-j/--json-report` for report in a json format, or can be exported using [`exportReports`](./mixcr-exportReports.md) command.

## Pre-clone assembler report

The first part of the report is dedicated to [UMI and cell barcodes based consensus assembly](./mixcr-assemble.md#pre-clone-assembler-parameters):

`Number of input groups`
: number of groups defined by unique barcodes combination. In case of single-cell UMI-barcoded library equals to unique CellId+UMI groups.

`Number of input alignments`
: Total number of alignments in the input `.vdjca` file.

`Number of output pre-clonotypes`
: Total number of consensuses assembled among all groups.

`Number of clonotypes per group`
: number consensus assembled per number of groups.
    ??? note "How to read this value"
        ```
        Number of clonotypes per group
        0: + 1209 (0.04%) = 1209 (0.04%)
        1: + 2891630 (98.45%) = 2892839 (98.5%)
        2~3: + 44182 (1.5%) = 2937021 (100%)
        ```
    
        - For 1209 groups 0 consensuses were assembled due to various reasons such as bad quality, low number of reads or other conflicts. 
        - For 2891630 groups 1 consensus was assembled. 
        - For 44182 groups 2 or 3 consensuses were assembled.

`Number of core alignments`
: number of alignments that cover `assemblingFeature` which were used to assemble consensuses

`Discarded core alignments`
: number of alignments that cover `assemblingFeature` but were not assigned to any consensuses

`Empirically assigned alignments`
: Number of alignments that do not cover `assemblingFeature` but were still assigned to consensuses. Those alignments will be used by [`mixcr assembleContigs`](mixcr-assembleContigs.md) if applied.

`Empirical assignment conflicts`
: Number of conflicts encountered in empirical assignment

`UMI+VJ-gene empirically assigned alignments`
: Number of alignments that were assigned to consensuses based on UMI, V and J genes sequences.

`VJ-gene empirically assigned alignments`
: Number of alignments that were assigned to consensuses based on V and J genes sequences.

`UMI empirically assigned alignments`
: Number of alignments that were assigned to consensuses based on UMI sequence.

`Number of ambiguous UMIs`
: number of UMI conflict events.

`Number of ambiguous V-genes`
: number of events when two or more consensuses inside alignment group share the same V-genes, thus V-gene driven empirical assignment was not possible.

`Number of ambiguous J-genes`
: number of events when two or more consensuses inside alignment group share the same J-genes, thus J-gene driven empirical assignment was not possible.

`Number of ambiguous UMI+V/J-gene combinations`
: number of UMI+V/J-gene conflict events.

`Unassigned alignments`
: alignments that were not assigned to any consensuses due to the various reasons

## Assembler and clustering report 

The rest of the report is describes assembly regardless of barcodes:

`Final clonotype count`
: Number of clonotypes left after all artificial diversity error-corrections (PCR-errors and V/J/C mis-assignment correction)

`Average number of reads per clonotype`
: Average number of reads per final clonotype

`Reads used in clonotypes, percent of total`
: Total number of reads assembled into final clonotypes (percent of total number of reads). This number excludes or includes reads from clonotypes eliminated in error-correction depending on `-OaddReadsCountOnClustering`

`Reads used in clonotypes before clustering, percent of total`
: Number of reads used in clonotypes before clustering (PCR-error correction) (percent of total number of reads)

`Number of reads used as a core, percent of used`
: number of core alignments with no low quality nucleotides (defined by `badQualityThreshold`). These alignments form core clonotypes. (percent of reads used in clonotypes)

`Mapped low quality reads, percent of used`
: Number of rescued low quality reads that were aggregated by the corresponding clonotype. See [mapping](mixcr-assemble.md#assemble-algorithm)

`Reads clustered in PCR error correction, percent of used`
: Number of reads clustered in PCR error correction, percent of used. See [clustering](mixcr-assemble.md#assemble-algorithm)

`Reads pre-clustered due to the similar VJC-lists, percent of used`
: Reads pre-clustered due to the similar VJC-lists, percent of used

`Reads dropped due to the lack of a clone sequence, percent of total`
: Reads dropped due to the lack of a clone sequence (`assemblingFeature`), percent of total

`Reads dropped due to low quality, percent of total`
: Reads dropped due to too many positions with low quality, percent of total

`Reads dropped due to failed mapping, percent of total`
: Reads dropped due to failed mapping, percent of total. See [mapping](mixcr-assemble.md#assemble-algorithm)

`Reads dropped with low quality clones, percent of total`
: Reads dropped with low quality clones, percent of total

`Clonotypes eliminated by PCR error correction`
: Number of clonotypes eliminated by PCR error correction

`Clonotypes dropped as low quality`
: Number of clonotypes dropped due to low quality after mapping, pre-clustering and clustering.

`Clonotypes pre-clustered due to the similar VJC-lists`
: Clonotypes pre-clustered due to the similar VJC-lists
