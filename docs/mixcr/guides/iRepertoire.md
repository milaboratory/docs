# iRepertoire

Here we will discuss how to process the data obtained using iRepertoire TCR LR kit. This is a multiplex protocol designed in such a way that forward primers are located in FR1 region of V gene and reverse primers are complimentary to constant region. 

## Data libraries

This tutorial uses the data from the following publication: *Longitudinal High-Throughput Sequencing of the T-Cell Receptor Repertoire Reveals Dynamic Change and Prognostic Significance of Peripheral Blood TCR Diversity in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer During Chemotherapy* Yi-Tung Chen et al., Front. Immunol., 2022 Jan;12:743448 [doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.743448](https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.743448)

A total of 36 subjects, including 20 healthy controls and 16 metastatic CRC patients, were enrolled in this study.Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 20 age-matched healthy controls (62.6 ± 10.48 years old) and 16 CRC patients (62.38 ± 12.62 years old) before therapy. Among the 16 CRC patients, 67 peripheral blood samples were collected from 13 patients with follow-up every two months for approximately 98 to 452 days. 103 samples in total. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated following the standard procedure, and total RNA from PBMCs was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. A multiplex PCR amplification reaction was used to amplify the TCR immune repertoire. Human TCRα and TCRβ libraries were prepared using the HTAI-M and HTBI-M Kits (iRepertoire, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and 2 × 250 bp paired-end sequenced was performed on the Illumina MiSeq platform.

All data is available from SRA (PRJNA754274) using e.g. [SRA Explorer](https://sra-explorer.info).

The project contains 103 FASTQ file pairs. For the purpose of this tutorial we assume that all fastq files are stored  in `fastq/` folder. The structure of sequences is shown on the picture bellow. The data was obtained using multiplex primers for V and J genes. Below you can see the structure of cDNA library.

## Upstream analysis

MiXCR has a dedicated preset for this protocol, thus analysing the data ia as easy as:

```shell
--8<-- "guides/irepertoire-tcr-lr/scripts/020-upstream-preset.sh"
```

One might also use [GNU Parallel](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/) to process all samples at once:

```shell
--8<-- "guides/irepertoire-tcr-lr/scripts/020-upstream-preset-parallel.sh"
```

### Under the hood pipeline:

Under the hood `mixcr analyze irepertoire-human-tcr-cdr3` executes the following pipeline:

#### `align`
Alignment of raw sequencing reads against reference database of V-, D-, J- and C- gene segments.

```shell
--8<-- "guides/irepertoire-tcr-lr/scripts/040-upstream-align.sh"
```

Option `--report` is specified here explicitly.

`--species hsa`
: determines the organism species.

`-p`
: `default_4.0` a preset of MiXCR parameters which includes a specialized aligner for TCR data.


`-OvParameters.geneFeatureToAlign="VTranscriptWithout5UTRWithP"`
: Sets a V gene feature to align. Check [gene features](../reference/ref-gene-features.md) for more info.

`-OvParameters.parameters.floatingLeftBound=true`
: Results in a local alignment algorithm for V gene left bound due to the presence of primer sequences in V-gene region.

`-OjParameters.parameters.floatingRightBound=false -OcParameters.parameters.floatingRightBound=true`
: Results in a global alignment algorithm for J gene right bound and a local alignment algorithm for C-gene right bound due to the presence of primer sequences. 

#### `assemble`
Assembles alignments into clonotypes and applies several layers of errors correction(ex. quality-awared correction for sequencing errors, clustering to correct for PCR errors). Check [`mixcr assemble`](../reference/mixcr-assemble.md) for more information. By default, clones will be assembled by `CDR3` gene feature.

`-OseparateByJ=true`
: Split clones with the same `CDR3` sequence and different J-genes

```shell
--8<-- "guides/irepertoire-tcr-lr/scripts/050-upstream-assemble.sh"
```

#### `export`
Exports clonotypes from .clns file into human-readable tables.

```shell
--8<-- "guides/irepertoire-tcr-lr/scripts/060-upstream-exportClones.sh"
```

`-с <chain>`
: defines a specific chain to be exported.

After execution is complete the following list of files is generated for every sample:

```shell
# human-readable reports 
CRC016_preTherapy.report

# raw alignments (highly compressed binary file)
CRC016_preTherapy.vdjca

# TRA, TRB CDR3 clonotypes (highly compressed binary file)
CRC016_preTherapy.clns

# TRA, TRB CDR3 clonotypes exported in tab-delimited txt
CRC016_preTherapy.TRA.tsv
CRC016_preTherapy.TRB.tsv  
```

While `.clns` file holds all data and is used for downstream analysis using [`mixcr postanalisis`](../reference/mixcr-postanalysis.md), the output `.tsv` clonotype table will contain exhaustive information about each clonotype as well:

??? tip "See first 100 records from clonotype table CRC016_preTherapy:"
    {{ read_csv('docs/mixcr/guides/irepertoire-tcr-lr/figs/CRC016_preTherapy.clones.tsv', engine='python', sep='\t', nrows=100) }}

## Quality control

Now when we have all files processed lets perform Quality Control. The first thing to check is the alignment rate. That can be easily done using [`mixcr exportQc align`](../reference/mixcr-exportQc.md#alignment-reports) function.

```shell
--8<-- "guides/irepertoire-tcr-lr/scripts/080-qc-align.sh"
```

![alignQc.svg](irepertoire-tcr-lr/figs/alignQc.svg)


From this plot we can clearly see some issues with the libraries. A lot of the samples have a relatively big fraction of not aligned reads primarily due to the absence of J hits. 

MiXCR is a powerful tool that allows us to investigate further. Let's pick one of the samples where the issue is most obvious. (ex. CRC00308 ). To look at the reads' alignments for that sample we first will run [`mixcr align`](../reference/mixcr-align.md) command for that sample once again, but this time we will specify additional options - `-OallowPartialAlignments=true -OallowNoCDR3PartAlignments=true`, that will preserve partially aligned reads (ex. reads that may lack J gene) and reads that lack `CDR3` sequence.

```shell
--8<-- "guides/irepertoire-tcr-lr/scripts/090-qc-debug-align.sh"
```


Now we can look at raw alignments itself using [`mixcr exportAlignmentsPretty`](../reference/mixcr-exportPretty.md#raw-alignments).

The function bellow will generate a `.txt` human-readable file with alignments. We use parameter `--skip 1000` to skip first 1000 reads, as first reads usually have bad quality, and `--limit 100` will export only 100 alignments as we usually don't need to examine every alignment to see the issue.

```shell
--8<-- "guides/irepertoire-tcr-lr/scripts/110-qc-exportAlignmentsPretty.sh"
```

Bellow you can see a few alignments from the generated file. The first one is an example of well aligned reads.

One can use BLAST and search for the not aligned parts of sequence in order to find out its origin.

Another quality report we should investigate is a chain abundance plot.

```shell
--8<-- "guides/irepertoire-tcr-lr/scripts/120-qc-chainUsage.sh"
```


Most of the samples are more or less equally consist of TRA and TRB chains. Although we can also see a few samples (ex. CRC013_therapy-02) with no TRA chain wich might indicate some cDNA library reparation issues and needs further investigation.

## Full-length clonotype assembly

iRepertoire protocol allows to recover a broader BCR receptor sequence then just `CDR3` region. According to the protocol, forward primers are located in `FR1` region, thus we can safely use an assembling feature that starts from `CDR1` and be sure that no primers will affect the original sequence. The reverse primers are located in `FR4` region very close to `CDR3`, thus there is not much left from to include in clone assembly.

Taking into account what is mentioned above, the longest possible assembling feature for this protocol is `"{CDR1Begin:CDR3End}"`.

MiXCR has a specific preset to obtain full-length BCR clones with Biomed2 protocol:

```shell
--8<-- "guides/irepertoire-tcr-lr/scripts/130-upstream-preset-full-length.sh"
```

The `mixcr assemble` step in this preset differs from the one above in the following manner:

```shell
--8<-- "guides/irepertoire-tcr-lr/scripts/140-upstream-assemble-full-length.sh"
```

`-OassemblingFeatures="{CDR1Begin:CDR3End}"`
: sets the assembling feature to the region which starts from `CDR1Begin` and ends at the end of `CDR3`.


## Reports

Finally, MiXCR provides a very convenient way to look at the reports generated at ech step. Every `.vdjca`, `.clns` and `.clna` file holds all the reports for every MiXCR function that has been applied to this sample. E.g. in our case `.clns` file contains reports for `mixcr align` and `mixcr assemble`. To output this report use [`mixcr exportReports`](../reference/mixcr-exportReports.md) as shown bellow. Note `--json` parameter will output a JSON-formatted report.

```shell
--8<-- "guides/irepertoire-tcr-lr/scripts/125-qc-exportReports.sh"
```

```shell
--8<-- "guides/irepertoire-tcr-lr/scripts/125-qc-exportReports-json.sh"
```
